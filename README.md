# EfficientMaxEigenpair
An implementation for using efficient initials to compute the
maximal eigenpair in R. It provides three algorithms to find the efficient
initials under two cases: the tridiagonal matrix case and the general matrix
case. Besides, it also provides two algorithms for the next to the maximal 
eigenpair under these two cases.
