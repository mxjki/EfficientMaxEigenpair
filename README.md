# EfficientMaxEigenpair
An implementation for using efficient initials to compute the
maximal eigenpair in R. It provides two algorithms to find the efficient
initials under two cases: the tridiagonal matrix case and the general matrix
case. Besides, it also provides algorithms for the next to the maximal eigenpair under
these two cases.
